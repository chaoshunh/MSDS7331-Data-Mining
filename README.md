# MSDS7331-Data-Mining
This repo is to share all of the works we will do in MSDS 7331 Data Mining class.

We are planning to use Dallas Crime dataset which can be found here.
https://www.dallasopendata.com/Public-Safety/Police-Incidents/qv6i-rri7


This dataset represents the Dallas Police Public Data - RMS Incidents beginning June 1, 2014 to current-date. The Dallas Police Department strives to collect and disseminate police report information in a timely, accurate manner. This information reflects crimes as reported to the Dallas Police Department as of the current date. Crime classifications are based upon preliminary information supplied to the Dallas Police Department by the reporting parties and the preliminary classifications may be changed at a later date based upon additional investigation. Therefore, the Dallas Police Department does not guarantee (either expressed or implied) the accuracy, completeness, timeliness, or correct sequencing of the information contained herein and the information should not be used for comparison purposes over time. The Dallas Police Department will not be responsible for any error or omission, or for the use of, or the results obtained from the use of this information.

This online site is an attempt to make it easier for citizens to access offense reports. In disseminating this crime information, we must also comply with current laws that regulate the release of potentially sensitive and confidential information. To ensure that privacy concerns are protected and legal standards are met, report data is "filtered" prior to being made available to the public. Among the exclusions are:

1.) Sexually oriented offenses
2.) Offenses where juveniles or children (individuals under 17 years of age) are the victim or suspect
3.) Listing of property items that are considered evidence
4.) Social Service Referral offenses
5.) Identifying vehicle information in certain offenses
